## About
This is a flask blueprint maker. When you create a blueprint it will automatically make a route to it. There is a command to automatically create and update app.py (the file used to run the server) and you never need to modify it.

## How to use
You can actually use this right now. Just copy the file urn.py into the working directory and run the commands from terminal.<br>
Commands:
<ul>
    <li>python urn.py create blueprint_name (this will create a route to /blueprint_name)</li>
    <li>python urn.py update (this will update app.py)</li>
    <li>flask run</li>
</ul>

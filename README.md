## About
This is a flask blueprint maker. When you create a blueprint(with create command) it will automatically make a route to it. There is a command to automatically create and update app.py(the file used to run the server) and you never need to modify it.

## How to use
Run in terminal:
<ul>
    <li>python urn.py create blueprint_name (this will create a route to /blueprint_name)</li>
    <li>python update_app.py</li>
    <li>flask run</li>
</ul>

## Todo
This is a very early project version of the project. It will get updated and probably made into a package.
